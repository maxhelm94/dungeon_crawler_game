# dungeon_crawler_game
A dungeon crawler programmed in Java

Only files that were coded by myself were uploaded. These include classes that represent certain enemies with certain movement patterns.
Partly the movement pattern uses Dijkstra's algorithm to follow the player through the maze.
As my code was only a small part of the overall project, the code will not run, but demonstrates my coding skills for future employers.
